# AugustWilsonCycle
An educational mobile game exploring the history and culture of the Hill District in the city of Pittsburgh
# Introduction
Into the Hill: Explore August Wilson’s Hill District was created by a team from Carnegie Mellon University Entertainment Technology Center working with August Wilson House, a non-profit organization dedicated to the revitalization of August Wilson’s childhood home and the surrounding Hill District neighborhood in Pittsburgh. During his career, August Wilson wrote ten famous plays taking place in Pittsburgh's Hill District throughout different decades. This app allows you to explore the Hill District in two of those decades, with or without the use of an AR camera and printed map.
